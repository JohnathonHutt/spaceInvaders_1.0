# spaceInvaders_1.0
My personal take on a classic, with original artwork/sprites.

This game is currently desktop only - controls: arrow keys - left and right to move ship, up to fire laser.

You may not fire while under the shield, the shield is resistant to alien lasers but can only withstand three 'bombings' from the motherShip.

MotherShips scroll across the top of the screen each round. They require three shots to defeat - defeating a motherShip gives you 100 point bonus (normal aliens are 10 points each) and one extra life :).

All sprites/animations and the background were created by me for the purpose of this game.

Sound effects were used from the original space invaders, asteroid, Super Mario Bros (the one up sound) and (I think) a blaster from star wars (i.e. questionable youtube source).

The goal of this project was to create a reasonably polished, complete game using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks used) to practical understanding of animation and game developemnt with JavaScript/HTML5 canvas.
